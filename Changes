Change log
0.20  Tue Jan 15 14:03:22 PST 2019
    - Removed color support to make record nodes render properly
      again. Color support wasn't really all that great anyway,
      so removing it is not that big a sacrifice. Especially since
      the nodes actually *render* again!

	- added TODO in basic.t (dot bug fixed in some versions of dot)
        - changed make_all.pl to just use 'perl' instead of a full path;
