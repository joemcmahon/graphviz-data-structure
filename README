Description
 - GraphViz::Data::Structure produces simple and elegant visualizations
   of Perl data structures using Leon Brocard's GraphViz module.

Copyright
 - GraphViz::Data::Structure is copyright (c) 2001-2002 by Joe McMahon.
   All rights reserved. This program is free software; you can redistribute 
   it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself. 

Prerequisites
 - Test::More for running the test suite
 - GraphViz for actually rendering the graphs

Building it
 - You should be able to use a standard build sequence:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

   If you want to install it in your own library, do

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

Note: GraphViz 2.0 changed the way it was previously handling nodes with shape=record.
      A patch to restore the old behavior has been passed along to Leon, but until
      he cab get it in, GraphViz::Data::Structure handles doing the patch itself.
